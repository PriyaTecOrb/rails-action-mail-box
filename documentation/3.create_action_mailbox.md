## Create Action Mailbox using Ruby on Rails

We are creating a JavaScript countdown timer for the users so they can embed it into any websites via script tag

### Step 1: Setup rails project for the action mailbox


rails new rails-action-mail-box -d mysql

We are using mysql above

### Step 2: Install Devise gem for Manage Authentication Process

gem 'devise'

Now we install this gem by running command:

bundle install 

After that run command :

rails generate devise:install

### Step 3: Generate user model using Devise 
    
rails generate devise User 

### Step 4: Create and Migrate the databse


rails db:create

rails db:migrate

### Step 5: Generate Devise views for authentication process


rails generate devise:views users

Here we have customised devies view using bootstrap


### Step 6: Edit routes.rb and set root to counters#index:


# config/routes.rb
Rails.application.routes.draw do
 devise_scope :user do
    root to: "devise/sessions#new"
  end
  resources :products do
    resources :feedbacks
  end
  
  devise_for :users
end


### Step 7: Create a Action Mailbox for processing inbound emails:

  rails action_mailbox:install

  The above command generated ApplicationMailbox class looks like this.

  class ApplicationMailbox < ActionMailbox::Base
    # routing /something/i => :somewhere
  end
  
  # create  app/mailboxes/application_mailbox.rb

  # migration 20230203082508_create_active_storage_tables.active_storage.rb from active_storage
  # migration 20230203082509_create_action_mailbox_tables.action_mailbox.rb from action_mailbox


  Now run this below command:

  rails db:migrate

  #Now set this configuration in our development.rb file

  config.action_mailbox.ingress = :relay

### Step 8: Now we can define routes for emails. For ex:

  class ApplicationMailbox < ActionMailbox::Base
	  # routing /something/i => :somewhere
	  routing  :all => :feedbacks
	end


### Step 9: Generate scaffold to create CURD for any entity

Here we are generating scaffold for the product and feedback.


rails generate scaffold Product title:string description:text price:string

rails generate scaffold Feedback contect:text user:references product:references  


### Step 10: Next, we generate feedback mailbox  

  rails g mailbox Feedbacks


  It's looks like this :

  class FeedbacksMailbox < ApplicationMailbox
  
	  def process
	  end

	end

  The above class contains a method "process", to process the emails. In the above class, we can access mail object



### Step 10: Next, we have added authentication before processing the email

  class FeedbacksMailbox < ApplicationMailbox  
	  before_processing :user

	  def process
	  end

	  def user
      @user ||= User.find_by_email(mail.from)
    end

	end

 Now, we have got the user using mail.from 

### Step 10: Next, we need to fetch product id. For this we can set the reply emailâ€™s regex like:

  RECIPIENT_FORMAT = /feedback\-(.+)@example.com/i

  for example reply email : feedback-3@example.com 
  
  Here 3 is the product_id 


### Step 11: Next, now try to save user feedback on product using process method

  class FeedbacksMailbox < ApplicationMailbox
	  # mail = Mail.new
	  RECIPIENT_FORMAT = /feedback\-(.+)@example.com/i

	  before_processing :user

	  def process
	    if mail.parts.present?
	      Feedback.create! user_id: @user.id, product_id: product_id, content: mail.body.decoded
	    else
	      Feedback.create! user_id: @user.id, product_id: product_id, content: mail.decoded
	    end
	  end

	  def user
	    @user ||= User.find_by_email(mail.from)
	  end

	  def product_id  
	    recipient = mail.recipients.find { |r| RECIPIENT_FORMAT.match?(r) }
	    
	    # Returns the first_match and that is product_id
	    # For Ex: recipient = "feedback-3@example.com"
	    recipient[RECIPIENT_FORMAT, 1]
	  end
	end

	#we can also read any attachement if available with mail
  
  
### Step 12: Next, Test Our Action Mailbox functionality on development(local machine) enviorment :

   we can simply go to http://localhost:3000/rails/conductor/action_mailbox/inbound_emails/new


### Step 13: for production enviorment or Testing from server we need to use one of them from below options:

  1. Mailgun
	2. Mandrill
	3. Postfix
	4. Postmark
	5. Qmail
	6. SendGrid

### Step 14: For ex: we are using postmark than we need to set the below value in our enviorment:

   config.action_mailbox.ingress = :postmark

### Step 15: Next, we need to generate a strong password for Action Mailbox, by running the below command you can open the file:

  rails credentials:edit

### Step 16: Now we set password to our application's encrypted credentials, Action Mailbox will automatically find it:   

  action_mailbox:
    ingress_password: PASSWORD

### Step 16: We configure inbound webhook to forward inbound emails with the username "actionmailbx" and password we have generated in the above section: 

    https://actionmailbox:PASSWORD@example.com/rails/action_mailbox/postmark/inbound_emails
